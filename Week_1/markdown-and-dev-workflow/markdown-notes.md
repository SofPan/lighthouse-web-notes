# Git, Markdown and Dev Workflow

## Markdown can be parsed into HTML

* "#" Denotes a header. The more you have the lower the header level (h1 - h6)
* Links are made by ```[link Text](url)```
  * Relative links us the same markdown, but you would use your relative path for the url
* Backticks designate a code block, use three at the beginning and end
  * You can specify the language after the first three ticks
  * ```
    "```Javascript (code here)```"
    ```
