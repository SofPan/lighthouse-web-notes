# ES6 Template Literals

* Use backticks to surround template literals (``)
* Use ${ } to bring in variables or dynamic data to a string

```Javascript
  var foo = "bar";
  var num = 2;

  console.log(`There are ${num} things I like about ${foo}`); // prints "There are 2 things I like about bar";
```
